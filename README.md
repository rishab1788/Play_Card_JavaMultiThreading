# Play_Card_JavaMultiThreading
 
1. Construct a valid 52 card deck, with 4 suits and 13 cards (Ace through King)
of each suit.
2. Shuffle the deck so that cards are randomly distributed (each run of the
program should produce a different random distribution).
3. Deal a hand of five cards to five different players (build the hands by dealing
one card from the deck to each hand, passing around the players 5 times).
4. Write the hands out to a text file with each hand sorted by value in ascending
order (with Ace being the highest value)
5. Each card should be written out as value followed by suit:
a. Values = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A
b. Values Suits = H, D, S, C (Heart, Diamond, Spade, Club)
6. Each card should be separated by a dash.
7. We are looking for object-oriented programming techniques: at a minimum
you should have classes to represent a Card, Deck and Hand.
The resulting output should look like the following:
Player #1: 2C-3H-5D-9H-AS
Player #2: 5C-8S-10H-QS-KC
Player #3: 3D-8C-8H-9C-AH
Player #4: 6H-7C-KD-AD-AC
Player #5: 4S-4C-9D-10C-10S
